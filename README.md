# Inspiration
We were inspired by the increased amount of online shopping due to the social distancing constraints. We think that in a post-quarantine world, people will be motivated to spend more on clothes to refresh their closet. Given that textile waste is already such a huge pollution problem, we wanted to encourage people to catalogue and remix their existing closet items before purchasing new ones. It also suggests local clothing drives / donation depots to redirect clothes to people in need and keep the clothes out of landfills.

# What it does
Mycloset.space is a mobile app that catalogues each item in a given closet and allows the user to tag it with attributes (ex. summer, casual, colour). Once catalogued, it allows users to sort their closet by tags, ocassion, category (ex. tops, bottom, shoes) and colour. User can even combine items to create and save outfit ideas.

# How we built it
It's built using the MERN stack, the backend is built on Express.js and mongoDB and the front-end is built using React.js.

# Challenges we ran into
The most challenging aspect of this project was building a frontend designed for mobile use.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of implementing and testing a working back-end for this project. Users can effectively store information about their closet items and outfit ideas.

# What we learned
We learned that we should place more emphasis on the design and prototyping aspects of the front-end to reduce the amount of time spent making decisions about small but important details.

# What's next for mycloset.space
To further help with the environmental cost of fast fashion and textile waste, we think it would be a good idea if mycloset.space helped users locate nearby clothing donation centres and encouraged them to donate their gently used clothing items.
